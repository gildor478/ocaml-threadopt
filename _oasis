Description:
  ThreadOpt is a library that provides thread-safe locking primitives. It
  actually doesn't pull any thread library, except if compiled with "mt"
  predicate of ocamlfind. 
  .
  When the library is used with threading support enabled, no lock are
  enforced. As soon as the library is used with "mt" enabled, it turns on
  classical Thread-safe operations.
  .
  This library is particularly useful to build other libraries that will
  abstract thread operations.
